## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **`frontend/`**: Contains the React.js application for the user interface.
- **`backend/`**: Hosts the Express.js server, API routes, and MongoDB integration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prethish-Kumar/E-Invoicing-Readiness-Gap-Analyzer.git
cd E-Invoicing-Readiness-Gap-Analyzer
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the React application:

```bash
npm run build
```

> **Note:** You do not need to start the React server. The Express backend serves the built files in production.

### 3. Set Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd ../backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_database_name
```

4. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a remote URI in `.env`.

5. Start the backend server:

```bash
node index.js
```

> The server will automatically serve the React frontend build and API routes.
